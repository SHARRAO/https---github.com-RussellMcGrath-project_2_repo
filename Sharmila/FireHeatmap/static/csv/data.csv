Recent wildfires and their effects on communities have underscored the need for the continuance of fuels reduction projects. Fuels reduction not only helps to make communities more defensible during wildfires, but also improves a forest’s resiliency to wildfire.Fire managers use pile burning as one way to reduce fuels on National Forest lands. Piles may be produced as a result of logging activities where slash and tops are piled at landings for burning purposes, or may be created by hand thinning in areas where heavy equipment can’t be used to thin the forest. Pile burning is effective because it can be accomplished during wet or snowy conditions, allowing a long window of time for burning opportunities.
